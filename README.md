# resource_fork.ksy

[Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) specs for a few Macintosh resource formats.

This repo previously also contained specs for the resource fork format itself and for the compressed data formats used by System 7's resource compression.
These specs have been moved to the official kaitai_struct_formats repo -
see [macos/resource_fork.ksy](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/master/macos/resource_fork.ksy) and the rest of the [macos](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/tree/master/macos) directory.
